        <p class="question" id="ques1">How can I check in for today?</p>
        <p class="answer" id="ans1">
          If you didn't check in today, there will be a button in you Home page,
          "Go input today's sleep quality". Or you can click CHECK IN in the
          navigation bar. Once you do fill out the questionnaire, the screen
          will be replaced with a dashboard displaying your sleep hours, score,
          and quality, along with some recommendations for improvement.

        <p class="question" id="ques2">How is the sleep score calculated?</p>
        <p class="answer" id="ans2">
          The sleep score is calculated by combining hours slept (scaled to a
          maximum of 100), sleep quality (scaled to a maximum of 10), and
          penalties for pre-bed activities (10 points per activity). The final
          score is adjusted to stay within 0â€“100, providing an overall measure
          of sleep health.

      <div class="question-container" id="container3">
        <p class="question" id="ques3">How can I add more friends?</p>
        <p class="answer" id="ans3">
          You can add more friends by going to the Community Page. The bottom
          section is where you can search your friends' names and add them with
          + sign. Your friends' names will appear in the leaderboard according
          to their respective points.

      <div class="question-container" id="container4">
        <p class="question" id="ques4">How can I see my past record?</p>
        <p class="answer" id="ans4">
          You can see your past records by going to the Home page calendar. Each
          date on your calendar that has a registered sleep score has an
          assigned color. You can see your relative status based on the color
          (low-red: 0-49, medium-yellow: 50-79, high-green: 80-100).
